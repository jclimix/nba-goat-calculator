# NBA GOAT Calculator

Welcome to the NBA GOAT Calculator project! This Python web application is designed to help you determine the greatest basketball players of all time based on various metrics. Whether you're a die-hard NBA fan or just curious about basketball history, this tool is here to assist you in identifying the GOATs of the game.

## How It Works

The NBA GOAT Calculator utilizes Python to create a web application. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Input Form**: Users provide input through a form, specifying their preferences and criteria for ranking NBA players.

2. **Data Parsing**: The application reads NBA data from a CSV file named `jmg-nba-dataset.csv`. This dataset contains comprehensive statistics and information about NBA players throughout history.

3. **Metric Ranking**: Based on the user's input, the application ranks NBA players according to various metrics such as points per game, rebounds, assists, championships, etc.

4. **GOAT Calculation**: Using the ranked metrics, the application calculates which NBA players are considered the greatest of all time (GOAT). This is done by applying weights to different metrics based on the aforementioned form filled by the user.
